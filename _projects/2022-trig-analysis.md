The final project for my MAE 3270 Mechanics of Engineering Materials class was to design a 3/8" drive torque wrench rated for 50 ft-lb of torque (600 in-lb), required to attain at least 1.0mV/V strain gauge voltage near the drive, fully reversible torque for 10^6 cycles, safety factor of 4 for yield failure, safety factor of 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack depth of 0.04 in, and fatigue stress safety factor of 1.5.


## **CAD Model Dimensions**

I created an interated design based on a provided base model in Fusion. The model includes a 3/8" drive and location for a strain gauge, in addition to basic components such as the handle and a grip extension to apply the torque from.
