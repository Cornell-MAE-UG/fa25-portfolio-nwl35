For the final project for my MAE 3260 System Dynamics class, me and a group analyzed the system dynamics of an RC car. The end goal was to be able to describe the system using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to show different states of the system.

The ODEs were made to link how the DC motors translated electricity to acceleration of the car. The system was written in a state-space format to describe the motor current and car's speed as two distinct states, and a transfer function to convert one to another can be derived from this to describe the system.
