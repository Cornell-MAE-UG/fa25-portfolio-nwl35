For the final project for my MAE 3230 Introduction to Fluid Mechanics class, in addition to helping to manually take apart the leaf blower, I calculated the lost velocity due to viscous forces in the tube part of a leaf blower. This involved finding a viscous drag force from a Moody chart, approximating the surface roughness of the leaf blower tube to equal that of PVC. Then, I used the change in Bernoulli constant equation to calculate pressure loss due to viscous forces, and then equated this to velocity from the Bernoulli equation. My calculations are shown at timestamp 3:35 in the video, attached below.
