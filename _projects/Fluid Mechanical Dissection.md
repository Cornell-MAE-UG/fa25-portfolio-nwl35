For the final project for my MAE 3230 Introduction to Fluid Mechanics class, in addition to helping to manually take apart the leaf blower, I calculated the lost velocity due to viscous forces in the tube part of a leaf blower. This involved finding a viscous drag force from a Moody chart, approximating the surface roughness of the leaf blower tube to equal that of PVC. Then, I used the change in Bernoulli constant equation to calculate pressure loss due to viscous forces, and then equated this to velocity from the Bernoulli equation.
